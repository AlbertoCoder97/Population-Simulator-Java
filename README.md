# Population-Simulator-Java
This simulator is made for a college exam by Alberto Calabrese.
This simulator consists of creating a population made by 4 kind of people :
Morigerati, Avventurieri, Prudenti and Spregiudicate.

Morigerati are the men that want to have a family with a woman and help them to raise their kids.
Avventurieri is the exact opposite. They want just adventures.

Prudenti are the kind of women that don't concede if they don't want to and only after some time.
Spregiudicate are the women that if they want to concede to a man they do.

The couples get a prize for each kid they have dependent on the type of the woman and man.
